// Bubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through a list of values,
// compares adjacent pairs, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
// The algorithm stops when the list is sorted.
// It is named based on the way that small elements 'bubble' up to the top
// of the list. 
// It is a simple, but slow algorithm and is impractical for most problems
// compared to other sorting algorithms such as "insertion sort".
// Bubble sort can be practical if the elements being sorted are already mostly
// in sorted order with some elements nearly in position. 
// Bubble sort has a worst case and average case time complexity of O(nÂ²) and a
// best case complexity of O(n) when the list of values is already sorted.

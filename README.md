# Bubble Sort
> The [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm works by stepping through a list of values, comparing adjacent pairs, and swaping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm stops when the list is sorted. It is named based on the way that small elements "bubble" to the top of the list. It is a simple but slow algorithm, and is impractical for most problem compared to other sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort. Bubble Sort has a worst case and average case time complexity of O(nÂ²) and a best case complexity of O(n), when the list of values is already sorted.
